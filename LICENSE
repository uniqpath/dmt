DMT LICENSE v1.0
----------------

 IF YOU GET ACCESS TO THIS CODE, IT IS YOURS. DO AS YOU PLEASE.
 (EXCEPT THINGS IN THE EVIL OR UNWISE CATEGORY OF COURSE!).

----------------------------------------------------------------

"dmt next" (WHICH IS A METHOD FOR FETCHING THE NEXT ITERATION OF
dmt-system FROM PRECONFIGURED "dmtSource"). MIGHT REPLACE, ADD OR
REMOVE CODE (EXCEPT CODE AND ASSETS ADDED BY YOU IN ~/.dmt/user).

WE ALWAYS INCLUDE DEPENDENCIES THAT USE SIMILAR ULTRA-PERMISSIVE
CODE LICENCE BUT IF SOMEONE LATER COMES AND INTERPRETS THEIR
LICENCE AS LESS PERMISSIVE, WE SWITFLY REMOVE IT AND INCLUDE
OR CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE AND POSSIBLY EVEN BETTER SOLUTION WHICH
THEN REPLACES UNPERMISSIVE CODE. THIS PROJECT PROMISES TO ALWAYS
BE FREE FREE FREE. WE MIGHT INNOVATE WITH BUSINESS MODELS IN THE
FUTURE BUT WE WILL NEVER SELL THE CODE ITSELF NOR TRY TO MONETIZE
THE USER BASE IN NON-TRANSPARENT WAY, IN FACT WE COULDN'T BECAUSE
THE SYSTEM DESIGN AS IT STANDS NOW (AND IN THE FUTURE) DOES NOT
TECHNICALLY ALLOW ANY TRACKING, GATHERING OF ANY USER DATA, ANY USER
LOCK-INS OR ANY OTHER SOMETIMES "STANDARD TECHNOLOGY PRACTICES".

THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS NOT FOR EVERY PERSON TO USE IT AS THEY
DO WITH SOME OTHER WELL KNOWN CENTRALIZED SYSTEMS. IT HAS A VERY-
VERY-VERY LONG-TERM VISION INSTEAD AND CAN SURVIVE A VERY-VERY-VERY
SLOW GROWTH. WE JUST WANT TO FIND A CURIOUS PERSON HERE AND THERE WHO
COULD USE AND BENEFIT FROM THE SYSTEM AS IT IS EXISTING NOW. THE GOAL
OF THIS SYSTEM IS TO "JUST WORK" AND BE UNDER TOTAL USER CONTROL.
THIS IS A RARE COMBINATION BECAUSE USUALLY IF SOFTWARE SERVICE
"JUST WORKS", SOMEONE ELSE IS TAKING CARE OF IT FOR YOU. NOT HERE.
BUT THAT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED, "SOMEBODY ELSE" (THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
THROUGH RECENT COMPUTING HISTORY) HAVE DEVELOPED KNOWLEDGE, SCIENCE,
TECHNOLOGY AND ACTUAL PRODUCTS THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE USED WITHOUT ANY
BIG-BROTHER-IN-THE-SKY OVERSIGHT.

USER NEEDS SOME LEARNING, SOME INITIAL CONFIGURATION AND THAT IS IT.
THEN THE USER CAN REST ON THE FIRM PLATFORM OF STABILITY AND INDEPENDENCE
WHICH HE CAN TWEAK AS SHE PLEASES AND IN DIFFERENT CAPACITY DEPENDING ON
THEIR WISHES, OPENNESS TO TINKERING AND TECHNICAL INTEREST. THEY CAN FULLY
DECIDE WHERE TO TAKE IT NEXT.

THE TIME FOR REAL *PERSONAL COMPUTING* HAS ARRIVED. DO NOT ACCEPT
SOLUTIONS THAT USE YOU INSTEAD OF YOU USING AND COMMANDING *THEM*.
YOU ARE NOT INSIGNIFICANT IN FRONT OF TECHNOLOGY, YOU MASTER TECHNOLOGY
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD AND FOR THE GOOD OF THOSE AROUND YOU. DMT SHOWS YOU
CLEARLY THAT THIS IS POSSIBLE AND TEACHES YOU HOW TO SEARCH AND FIND
SOLUTIONS AND SYSTEMS THAT ARE BUILT WITH THE SAME PRINCIPLES. YOU
WILL ALSO LEARN TO DETECT IF AND WHEN THEIR PRINCIPLES START TO ERODE
BECAUSE EVERYTHING CHANGES OR AT LEAST CAN CHANGE AND YOU HAVE TO KNOW
WHICH CHANGE IS GOOD FOR YOUR WELL-BEING AND WHEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO
CONSIDER CUTTING TIES WITH SOME PAST TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE TURNING BAD.

ALL ASSETS INCLUDED (WALLPAPERS) ARE TAKEN "from the web" BY CHECKING
PERMISSIONS AS WELL. WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT AUTHOR WOULD LATER CHANGE
THE PERMISSIONS THOUGH AND THUS THE SAME THING HOLDS: WE WILL TAKE FEW
POSSIBLE COMPLAINTS SERIOUSLY AND REMOVE ANY MATERIAL THE AUTHOR THINKS
DOES NOT BELONG HERE. BUT OF COURSE: WALLPAPERS ARE EXTENSIBLE AND IF
THE MATERIAL IS STILL AVAILABLE SOMEWHERE IN DIGITAL FORM, THE END USER
CAN JUST CONFIGURE THEIR SYSTEM TO USE THAT. THERE IS NO WAY TO PREVENT
DIGITAL INFORMATION TO GO AROUND AND WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHERE IT IS GOOD
MORALS TO PAY OR SUPPORT AUTHORS OF HIGH-QUALITY DIGITAL GOODS LIKE
PHOTOS, VIDEOS, MUSIC AND EVEN TEXT OF COURSE. WE ALSO HAVE TO LEARN AND
DISTINGUISH WHEN ARE WE PAYING AUTHORS DIRECTLY OR IF NOT, WHAT DO THEY
ACTUALLY GET BY GOING THROUGH MIDDLEMEN. A LOT MORE ARTISTS COULD SURVIVE
IF WE BOUGHT DIGITAL MATERIAL (AND NOT STREAM IT!) FROM THEM, THEN SAVE IT
ON OUR SYSTEMS TO BE USED INDEFINITELY AND IN REALLY HIGH QUALITY DIGITAL
ENCODING. STREAMING IS A NICE AND USEFUL SHORTCUT FOR NOW BUT WE HAVE
FORGOTTEN THE OLD WAYS IN THIS REGARDS AS WELL. BUT THE OLD WAYS WILL COME
BACK BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS DO. AND THEY COME BACK IMPROVED AND MODERNIZED.
