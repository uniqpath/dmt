## üê† Zeta Explorers Network

A **Zeta Explorer Node** is a `dmt-proc` which is:

- running on a server with public IP address
- is part of **Zeta Explorers Network**
- is auto-updating<sup>*</sup> to keep compatible with other nodes in the network
- provides all further education about the **dmt-system** and it's capabilities

<sup>*</sup> <i>from GitHub, infrequently, a few seconds downtime on each update</i>

In *Zeta Explorers Network* you learn how to use *Zeta/DMT* **outside of any network** but your own.

Entirely disconnected / private use cases are actually *one of the most valid use cases* but a little bit harder to set up and understand initially. Some learning experience is needed and that's one of the reasons for Zeta Explorers Network to exist in the first place.

**[ it becomes much less confusing after you install your first node ]**
