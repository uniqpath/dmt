## 🐠 Zeta Explorers Network

A **Zeta Explorer Node** is a `dmt-proc` which is:

- running on a server with public IP address
- is part of **Zeta Explorers Network**
- is auto-updating<sup>*</sup> to keep compatible with other nodes in the network
- provides all further education about the **dmt-system** and it's capabilities

<sup>*</sup> <i>from GitHub, infrequently, a few seconds downtime on each update</i>

In *Zeta Explorers Network* you learn how to use *Zeta/DMT* and all about `dmt-proc` (that is indeed a little bit of cyclic reference in case you expected full explanation at this point). 

You can then use the same technology **disconnected from any network** as a 100% private use case.

Entirely disconnected / private use cases are actually *one of the most valid use cases* but a little bit harder to set up and understand initially. Some learning experience is needed and that's one of the reasons for Zeta Explorers Network to exist in the first place.

By *exploring* you also learn how to use the **Swarm** 🐝 client as well as few more great incoming technologies.

**TIP** 💡it becomes much less confusing after you install your first node 🐠

For live Q&A / DEMO please join one of ZetaMeet meetups each friday at 5pm CET. Write to zeta@uniqpath.com for invite.
