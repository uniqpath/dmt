dmt stop

cp dmt-proc.plist /Library/LaunchAgents

cd /Library/LaunchAgents

sudo chown root:wheel dmt-proc.plist

sudo nano dmt-proc.plist

replace my_user with your main user account on the machine under which dmt-proc should run

(check what permissions other files have)

test:

sudo bash -l

root@computer:~$ launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/dmt-proc.plist

dmt

it should report that dmt is running

now reboot computer and process should run before any user is logged in

Some background info:

https://superuser.com/a/130819/220321

~/Library/LaunchAgents         Per-user agents provided by the user.
/Library/LaunchAgents          Per-user agents provided by the administrator.
/Library/LaunchDaemons         System wide daemons provided by the administrator.
/System/Library/LaunchAgents   Mac OS X Per-user agents.
/System/Library/LaunchDaemons  Mac OS X System wide daemons.

Remark: /Library/LaunchDaemons might seem like a better idea because dmt-proc starts even if after computer reboot another user logs in first ... but a few things will break:
- desktop notifications
- putting computer to sleep won't work until admin user logs in at least once

If /Library/LaunchAgents is used then dmt-proc only runs after that user (main admin) logs in at least once ... and then everything works.
