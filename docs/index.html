.dmt is a suite of command-line tools for Unix based systems like Linux and macOS.

-= THEY MAKE LIFE SIMPLER =-

You can try this for start:

  mkdir ~/dmt-test
  cd ~/dmt-test
  mkdir Alice
  mkdir Bob
  mkdir Charlie

Now for .dmt magic:

  c a
  ..      [this is an actual command, short for "cd .."]
  c b
  ..
  c li

What do you think?

Now try:

  cd ~/dmt-test
  mkdir Alice/in_woderland
  mkdir Alice/on_the_roof

Just to make sure, the whole tree structure now looks like this:

.
├── Alice
│   ├── in_woderland
│   └── on_the_roof
├── Bob
└── Charlie

Try a few more .dmt commands:

  l a
  c a/i
  ...
  c a/o

Now check out the "t" command (short for "better caT"), preparation:

  cd ~/dmt-test
  echo "Claude Shannon" > information.txt
  echo "John von Neumann" > game_theory.txt
  echo "Murray Gell-Mann" > complex_systems.txt

See how to read files quickly:

  t info
  t the
  t co

Now install `highlight` for even better capabilities:

  brew install highlight (macOS)
  sudo apt-get install highlight (macOS)

do this:

  echo "console.log('mooo')" > index.js

Confirm that syntax highlighting works now:

  t in

Run the code (it is assumed that you have node.js installed):

  r in

Or just:

  r

Create another file:

  echo "console.log('hello world')" > output.js

Run this program:

  r o
  r out
  ...

Clean up:

  rm -rf ~/dmt-test

What you saw here are just four commands ("c", "l", "t" and "r"), to learn about much more do this:
