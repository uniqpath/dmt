DMH SHELL is a suite of command-line tools for Unix based systems like Linux and macOS.

Reasons to exist:

- To serve as a stable playground for developing easy to install, update and share p2p, IoT and other modular software.
- To equalize the command line between Linux and macOS devices, including servers and single board computers.
- To equalize the command line (and broader functionality via packages) between all your PC / IoT machines.
- To optimize for efficiency: maximum amount of functionality / impact for minimum amount of typing / thinking.

Design goals:

- Very easy install and clean removal.
- Small initial download size.
- Once installed on one of your machines, it can spread "like a virus" to all the others (only on your request, technically impossible otherwise).
- Integrity and safety (no hidden traps).
- Commands with as little keystrokes as possible - you can most of the time type just a few letters of the command and command line will know exactly what you ment. This is useful, but especially useful when controlling one or more of your machines from a mobile phone.

You have to make sure your `~/.bash_aliases` is actually included from `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile` or `.profile`, like this:

```
# Alias definitions.
if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
 . ~/.bash_aliases
fi
```

This is true by default on most systems, so it should just work. Try:

`dmt`

Spreading and dissemination

Every useful piece of code should have an easy way to replicate itself, try:

    dmt update pi@raspberry.local

if you have one of the RaspberryPy computers with default settings on your network. Now it too has a copy of `.dmt` framework installed.

Tutorial

You can try this for start:

  mkdir ~/dmt-test
  cd ~/dmt-test
  mkdir Alice
  mkdir Bob
  mkdir Charlie

Now for .dmt magic:

  c a
  ..      [this is an actual command, short for "cd .."]
  c b
  ..
  c li

What do you think?

Now try:

  cd ~/dmt-test
  mkdir Alice/in_woderland
  mkdir Alice/on_the_roof

Just to make sure, the whole tree structure now looks like this:

.
├── Alice
│   ├── in_woderland
│   └── on_the_roof
├── Bob
└── Charlie

Try a few more .dmt commands:

  l a
  c a/i
  ...
  c a/o

Now check out the "t" command (short for "better caT"), preparation:

  cd ~/dmt-test
  echo "Claude Shannon" > information.txt
  echo "John von Neumann" > game_theory.txt
  echo "Murray Gell-Mann" > complex_systems.txt

See how to read files quickly:

  t info
  t the
  t co

Now install `highlight` for even better capabilities:

  brew install highlight (macOS)
  sudo apt-get install highlight (macOS)

do this:

  echo "console.log('mooo')" > index.js

Confirm that syntax highlighting works now:

  t in

Run the code (it is assumed that you have node.js installed):

  r in

Or just:

  r

Create another file:

  echo "console.log('hello world')" > output.js

Run this program:

  r o
  r out
  ...

Clean up:

  rm -rf ~/dmt-test
