ONE LAST THING:

on macOS (when using it as a target - recipient of rsync connection),
it's good to install rsync v3+ via homebrew, and add this to .bashrc:

# we do that because of SSH, rsync in particular has to come from homebrew, not from system
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH

or you won't be able to successfuly rsync (dmt update, dirsync etc.) to this machine
