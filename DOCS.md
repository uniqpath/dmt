# DMT ENGINE

### Documentation sources

- DOCS1 â†’ [Beginner's Guide](https://docs.uniqpath.com/dmt)
- ðŸ’¡ **DOCS2** â†’ [Help directory in this repo](https://github.com/uniqpath/dmt/tree/main/help)
- ðŸ’¡ **DOCS3** â†’ [Blog](https://davidhq.com/blog/tag/dmt-system)

Additionally (mostly RPi guide):

- DOCS4 â†’ [Info repository](https://github.com/uniqpath/info)

### Why different places? 

DOCS1 is easy to use for us (add pictures, edit online etc.) but we depend on third party (GitBook)

**DOCS2** is what matters the most and added benefit is that you get all this info automatically by cloning the repo (Installing DMT ENGINE)

**DOCS3** is self-hosted blog with more philosophical takes, it takes some maintenance but we are independent from third party, however you don't get a copy of data... good thing is that these posts are to be read once and then you don't need to come back to it like you possibly always revisit DOCS2

DOCS4 is again very safe on GitHub and anyone can clone it but it's more resource heavy because it hosts images etc. These assets are sometimes referenced from other places etc... There is usually no need to clone this but you can. In the future we may also automate construction of DMT DOCUMENTATION in pdf format which will combine everything from DOCS2 and possibly some blog posts and latest PDF will be available from the DOCS4 repo. 

Sounds like a plan? Allright!!
