ðŸ’¡ You can have your <a href="https://github.com/uniqpath/dmt/blob/main/help/TRY_DMT_SEARCH.md">Own Zeta Node</a>.

This is a fully decentralized search engine without any bootnodes. It can be used on one or more usersâ€™ machines and nodes can interconnect. One node running in production is ZetaSeek.com, serves as a demo and also has useful content. Anyone installing the software locally can also easily download zetaseek search index and search over it fully in private. They can also add own links and use this as a cool bookmarking service / search engine. Searches directly in file system are also very much supported. This is a longterm project, weâ€™re in 2nd year now.
