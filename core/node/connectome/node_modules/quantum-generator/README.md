# Quantum Generator

### How should you navigate this sacred quantum matrix?

You will soon be reborn by a power deep within yourself — a power that is non-local, non-local. As you self-actualize, you will enter into infinite learning that transcends understanding. Child, look within and inspire yourself. How should you navigate this Vedic quantum matrix? Astral projection may be the solution to what’s holding you back from an enormous lightning bolt of potential.

We must learn how to lead spiritual lives in the face of delusion. We can no longer afford to live with discontinuity. It is time to take wisdom to the next level. It can be difficult to know where to begin. Nothing is impossible.
