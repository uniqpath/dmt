### Purpose

This library was created to implement:

- a LAN-decentralized music player _(currently under further development)_
- a fully decentralized search network _(currently in growth phase and also under heavy development)_

Both projects reached v1.0 successfully and this library was extracted from them for use on further [dmt-system experiments](https://github.com/dmtsys). Both player and network backend and frontend **all-in-one** _(â‰¡ full node)_ solution is at [uniqpath/dmt](https://github.com/uniqpath/dmt). It is not yet well documented but you can look inside its `help` folder to find useful guides (how to install music player and how to set up a public search node). Instructions for using on [RaspberryPi computers](https://www.raspberrypi.org) are [here](https://github.com/uniqpath/info/blob/master/assets/pdf/rpi_guide.pdf). We recommend RPi 3B+ for your intelligent speakers, RPi4 is an overkill for now and it wastes electricity for this simple purpose.

### Symbol

Connectome logo uses the [resistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor) symbol because library helpes individuals push through resistance of the world's cabling and wireless networks to deliver their messages reliably, safely and as directly as possible. Physics offers the best possible fight to slow messages down but it is not enough and so digital computing usually manages to overcome all problems and deliver messages **quickly**. Messages travel by [Speed of electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_electricity) (= [Speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light) minus **The Resistance**). This is in good times, in time less great physical reality still wins and so messages arrive slowly or not at all. We just have to be optimistic they will soon be deliverable again and we wait patiently for network conditions to improve. _Connectome_ lets us see clearly that for time being **we are disconnected**. Disconnected computing is great (retro?) and partially disconnected networks are a big part of optimistic future.

Is this science ðŸ§ª or poetry?  ðŸ’• You decide! ðŸ‘€

### Connectome Library use on other projects

API is not yet stable but getting there! Please wait until v1.0 release if you want to use this library for your projects.

### Documentation

Soon. To help review the currently available docs write to hello@uniqpath.com or join one of **[friday dmt meetups](https://dmt-system.com)**.

### Showcases
