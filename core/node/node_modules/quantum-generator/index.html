      <h1>New Age Bullshit Generator</h1>

      <h2>Namaste. Do you want to sell a New Age product and/or service? Tired of coming up with meaningless copy for your starry-eyed customers? Want to join the ranks of bestselling self-help authors? We can help.</h2>

      <h3>Just click and the truth will manifest</h3>

      <p>Click the <em>Reionize electrons</em> button at the top of the page to generate a full page of New Age poppycock.</p>

      <p>The inspiration for this idea came from watching philosophy debates involving Deepak Chopra. I wrote a <a href="http://sebpearce.com/blog/bullshit/">blog post about it</a> if you're interested.</p>

      <p>After sitting through hours of New Age rhetoric, I decided to have a crack at writing code to generate it automatically and speed things up a bit. I cobbled together a list of New Age buzzwords and cliché sentence patterns and this is the result.</p>

      <blockquote>
        You’ll get some profound-sounding nonsense here, too.
      </blockquote>

      <p>So, what is this for? Put it on your website as placeholder text. Print it out as a speech for your yoga class and see if anyone can guess a computer wrote it. Use it to write the hottest new bestseller in the self-help section, or give false hope to depressed friends and family members.</p>

      <p>(If you haven’t seen it, check out <a href="http://www.wisdomofchopra.com/">wisdomofchopra.com</a> &mdash; unfortunately they beat me to it! I came across that page a few days after I’d finished the vocabulary list for this one. Must be synchronicity at work.)</p>
