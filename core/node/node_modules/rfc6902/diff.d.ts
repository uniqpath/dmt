All diff* functions should return a list of operations, often empty.

Each operation should be an object with two to four fields:
* `op`: the name of the operation; one of "add", "remove", "replace", "move",
  "copy", or "test".
* `path`: a JSON pointer string
* `from`: a JSON pointer string
* `value`: a JSON value

The different operations have different arguments.
* "add": [`path`, `value`]
* "remove": [`path`]
* "replace": [`path`, `value`]
* "move": [`from`, `path`]
* "copy": [`from`, `path`]
* "test": [`path`, `value`]

Currently this only really differentiates between Arrays, Objects, and
Everything Else, which is pretty much just what JSON substantially
differentiates between.

Calculate the shortest sequence of operations to get from `input` to `output`,

To get from the input ABC to the output AZ we could just delete all the input
and say "insert A, insert Z" and be done with it. That's what we do if the
input is empty. But we can be smarter.

          output
               A   Z

      C |  3   2  [2]

1) start at 0,0 (+0)
2) keep A (+0)
3) remove B (+1)
4) replace C with Z (+1)
