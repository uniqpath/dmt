# DMT GUI KIT

Svelte components and helper utilities used from DMT GUI, DMT MOBILE and other [DMT APPS](https://github.com/uniqpath/dmt/blob/main/help/DMT_APPS_SVELTE.md).

Use `npm run package` to produce the bundle.

Bundle ships with [DMT ENGINE](https://github.com/uniqpath/dmt) and this is an example of how to import it in `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "dmt-gui-kit": "~/.dmt/core/lib/dmt-gui-kit"
}
```
