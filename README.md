** dmt-system 1.0 release is on 1.1.2020 at midnight **

# dmt-system release 1.0 (soon)

## What is the purpose of dmt-system?

1.  LAN-decentralized multimedia player
2.  Home IoT control panel ("free open source home controller")
3.  LAN device-to-device messaging and coordination system

These three functions are interrelated and form a coherent whole. Function nr. 3 is invisible to the user and is working "behind the scenes" to support and enable the first two.

## Is it completely done/finished?

Yes, version 1.0 is completely finished, it won't change in significant ways or at all.
Furthermore there will almost certainly be no version 2.0 of a system with the same name.

## Does it contain any bugs?

Not to our knowledge.

## None?

Well. It does not contain a single known bug as far as our own code is concerned.

There are "minuscule" (depending on the viewpoint) systemic issues and glitches though. Since dmt-system is a product and a research project at the same time, we are reporting our exact observations. Issues we are talking about are further explained and put in context in Section 10.

## How feature complete is it?

Design space of general software systems is infinite and by this metric the system is not feature complete. It is rather limited in functionality but very very good at what it does. One of the important goals of the project besides practical usability is to serve as an inspiration (to ourselves and to anyone else) for further development in the area of personal dynamic helper systems on the boundary of real and digital.
