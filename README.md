## Install

    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uniqpath/dmt/master/shell/web-one-line-install-script | bash

or Update if already installed:

    dmt next

## Run

    dmt version

Now a lot should already work (see `dmt help`) but all of it is transactional on explicit user request (like http protocol for example). To get background processing and thus most out of the system, you will want to start a few background services (default ones are: `dmt-controller` and `search-and-play`) with:

    dmt start

See what the system is doing at each moment (hint: not much by design, only when needed and requested):

    dmt log

[More info](INSTALL.md)

## Where?

- servers _(example: for data and search processing)_
- **laptops or PCs** _(example: as a remote controller device for sbcs, as a consumer of personal server data etc.)_
- and especially **single board computers (SBC)** (RPi, odroid etc.) _(as digital slaves, as it should be)_

## But why?

Examples of what could be achieved with this technology:

## Computing Elves Inside Your Machine

‚ÄúIn short, I do not believe DMT is a gateway to an alternate dimension, nor does it induce contact with autonomous elves and alien entities. Yes, DMT produces a vivid other-worldly landscape when ingested, often including elves, aliens, insects, snakes, jaguars, etc. This is true for the majority of people who try it. Some people do not have such vivid responses, but many do. Although this may appear at first glance to be "shocking," it is actually no more shocking then the fact that most people dream at night, or that most people see geometric patterns (pressure phosphenes) when they close their eyes and press against their eyeballs. But the difference between pressure phosphenes and DMT is that DMT is illegal and very hard to come by, so most people never have the opportunity to experience it. If we could all hold our breath for a minute and produce vivid hallucinations of alien landscapes it would seem quite mundane, no more than a mere curiosity of the human condition. However, since this particular alien landscape is produced by a specific rare substance (DMT), people seem to think it is akin to unlocking the mysteries of the universe when they actually get their hands on it.‚Äù
