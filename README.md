### A few interesting commands:

See all other dmt-processes on your LAN:
```
dmt nearby
```


See `dmt-proc` in-memory state:
```
dmt state
```

See incoming and outgoing `fiber connections` (try opening `http://localhost:7777` first):
```
dmt connections
```

## Alternative dmtSource

There is an equivalent version available from [get-dmt.com](http://get-dmt.com) (one line install `curl get-dmt.com | bash`).

### Updating

If you installed from github, you can just `git pull` to get the new version.

If you ran `./install` and you have `dmt` command available, then you can use `dmt next` to get the next relase (from github as well as get-dmt.com).

```bash
$ dmt next

dmtSource: get-dmt.com

Current version : 1.1.91 Â· 2020-11-06
Next version    : 1.1.94 Â· 2020-11-13

## DMT on server

Please reach out for instructions (join a meetup via [dmt-system.com](https://dmt-system.com) or contact us on [Discord support](https://discord.gg/XvJzmtF)).

Server setup instructions are easy as well but some guidance can only help.
