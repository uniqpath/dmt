## USAGE MANUAL

[See here](USAGE_MANUAL.md)

# Background and motivation

We like computers and this project runs on computers of various kinds.

**It is (broadly speaking) about storage, transmission and manipulation of information.**

The system is distributed and time handling with synchronisation is important.

<img src="https://github.com/uniqpath/info/blob/master/assets/img/screens/screen4.jpg?raw=true">

It has a long-term vision of simplicity, composability and structural layering of modules to achieve almost infinite set of functionalities within a particular design space in an usable and understandable way. For now it is an early — working — experiment.

# DMT PROCESS

The DMT PROCESS (`dmt-proc`) is the main coordinator process that runs on each machine in dynamic **dmt-system** network.

**Interesting combination of technologies — dmt-system ~1.0:**

# Install

**Linux** (Debian, Raspbian etc.) / **macOS** / **Windows 10 Ubuntu shell**:

Short, simple and effective install 💡🚀🎸 —

```
git clone https://github.com/uniqpath/dmt.git ~/.dmt; cd ~/.dmt; ./install
```

See [complete install instructions](help/GETTING_STARTED.md) (you need a few dependencies like `node.js` ...).

## Update

This command will fetch changes from GitHub:

`dmt next`

## Uninstall

All you need is: `rm -rf ~/.dmt` (this removes the entire `~/.dmt` directory without asking)

Everything needed for the entire project lives inside this **one directory**.

⚠️ Be careful if you want to preserve your settings and other data inside `~/.dmt/user`.

## More explaining

This system (of code and data philosophy) is designed to save you time and effort in longterm instead of wasting it. It does require some initial setup and thought, of course. Systems with nearly zero initial effort tend to squeeze you "for something" in the longer term. This is quite obvious — if others keep doing all the effort and thinking for you, you owe them something for their (continued) work. If you do most of it yourself through open hardware and freely available software, then you don't owe anything to anyone and it should feel great.

# We are glad to help you get started

There is enough material on our <a href="https://github.com/uniqpath">GitHub</a> to get you started. In case you do need assistance, we are available for consulting and practical help at <a href="mailto:info@uniqpath.com">info@uniqpath.com</a>. Write us and we will find a solution! We think that during 2020 we can mostly help for free and if there is enough community and practical knowledge built up afterwards, we will then only offer more involved consulting for bigger system planning. All code on GitHub will always remain free.

## dmt-system v1.0 release

**Jan 1st 2020 was just a slow, a bit uneventful start.**

Expect a steady stream of useful updates during 2020 and onwards.

An experiment as well — [LICENSE](LICENSE) — have fun reading and don't laugh, it's true! ☻
