# dmt-system release 1.0

We built this simply because it didn't exist.
We made it radically good so you can make the most out of it.

** dmt-system 1.0 release is on 1.1.2020 at midnight **

v1.0.xyz in this repo is only for the "shell part"
(**core code** is entirely missing from this repo!)

## What is the purpose of dmt-system?

1.  LAN-decentralized multimedia player
2.  Home IoT control panel ("free open source home controller")
3.  LAN device-to-device messaging and coordination system

These three functions are interrelated and form a coherent whole. Function nr. 3 is invisible to the user and is working "behind the scenes" to support and enable the first two.

## Is it completely done/finished?

Yes, version 1.0 is completely finished, it won't change in significant ways or at all.

## Does it contain any bugs?

Not to our knowledge.

## None?

Well. It does not contain a single known bug as far as our own code is concerned.

There are "minuscule" (depending on the viewpoint) systemic issues and glitches though. Since dmt-system is a product and a research project at the same time, we are reporting our exact observations. Issues we are talking about are further explained and put in context in Section 10.

## So, what happens on 1.1.2020 at midnight?

Official website [dmt-system.com](https://dmt-system.com) gets updated, this repo receives **core code** and (more) documentation.

## Welcome to get prepared before that date

[Here is how ...](https://github.com/uniqpath/info) _(last section)_

You can enjoy January of 2020 setting up and getting to know your own **dmt-system**. By investing into some hardware **(click on the link just mentioned above)** and having it ready exactly when the software arrives, you will be motivated to go forward with this journey.
