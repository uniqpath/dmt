## STRAIGHT TO THE POINT?

💡🚀🎸 [HOW TO INSTALL](help/GETTING_STARTED.md) 💡🚀🎸

# Background and motivation

We like computers and this project runs on computers of various kinds.

**It is (broadly speaking) about storage, transmission and manipulation of information.**

<img src="https://github.com/uniqpath/info/blob/master/assets/img/screens/screen4.jpg?raw=true">

It has a long-term vision of simplicity, composability and structural layering of modules to achieve almost infinite set of functionalities within a particular design space in an usable and understandable way.

# DMT PROCESS

The DMT PROCESS (`dmt-proc`) is the main coordinator process that runs on each machine in dynamic **dmt-system** network.

**Interesting combination of technologies — dmt-system ~1.0:**

# Install

**Linux** (Debian, Raspbian etc.) / **macOS** / **Windows 10 Ubuntu shell**:

Short, simple and effective install 💡🚀🎸 —

```
git clone https://github.com/uniqpath/dmt.git ~/.dmt; cd ~/.dmt; ./install
```

or even

```
curl get-dmt.com | bash
```

See [HOW TO INSTALL DEPS - NODE.JS and MPV](help/GETTING_STARTED.md).

## Update

This command will fetch changes from GitHub:

`dmt next`

## Uninstall

All you need is: `rm -rf ~/.dmt` (this removes the entire `~/.dmt` directory without asking)

Everything needed for the entire project lives inside this **one directory**.

⚠️ Be careful if you want to preserve your settings and other data inside `~/.dmt/user`.

## Freedom to imagine

This is the world we are living in:
