       ✖ dmt-proc is not running

          ~ Try dmt start ~
```

💡 If you don't have `node.js` framework installed, please [read this](./help/NODEJS.md) to learn how to install it in the most maintainable way. 

Node.js is one of the greatest iterative (some would say revolutionary) inventions of recent years, DMT SYSTEM depends on it to function. We further depend on many great libraries that come bundled through DMT install itself. Open source is awesome and powerful. The real global proliferation of great fast software and ubiquitous computing has just barely begun.

💡 The entire DMT SYSTEM installation is contained inside one directory — `~/.dmt` and there is sometimes `~/.dmt-here` as well for strictly local information saved only on one device. That's it: two directories, never leaving artefacts around your file system.

## Start the engine

```
dmt start
```

See the new status with 

```
dmt
```

This time it will look something like this (in color):

         ✓ dmt-proc is running
```

To see the log where all important info is shown use this command:

```
dmt log
```

DMT log is stored in `~/.dmt/log/dmt.log` and it auto-truncates to the recent few thousand lines. You don't have to worry about it consuming your disk space over time. DMT SYSTEM takes care of details like this automatically so there is more time for productivity and added value instead of worrying about every last detail of correct setup.

Now stop the process with:

```
dmt stop
```

To get additional help use:

```
dmt help
```

## Indicating mainDevice

Edit device definition file, for example with `nano` editor:

```
nano ~/.dmt/user/devices/this/def/device.def
```

and uncomment `main` key, you can also give your device a custom name:

```
device: dmt-new
  
  # main: true
```

so after editing you have something like:

```
device: eclipse

  main: true
```

Main device is almost the same as any other but it tweaks a few parameters for better experience.

### Running DMT in terminal foreground

You can also spin up `dmt-proc` with:

```
dmt run
```

```

```

Which can be very helpful, especially when developing on top of the platform. You see the output directly without the need for using `dmt log` and you can restart `dmt-proc` frequently as needed by stopping it with `ctrl+c` and executing `dmt run` again.

This allows you to test the new code faster — things you may have added through "DMT USER ENGINE" or "DMT APPS" extensibility functionality of DMT SYSTEM. 

## DMT GUI

Open DMT GUI at `http://localhost:7777`

This GUI helped us iterate quickly and get us to where we are. Now it is being reworked for the next major version, planned for EOY 2022.

## DMT SYSTEM features

DMT SYSTEM has many great features but you can very easily try one of them by disconnecting your wifi. You should get _Internet unreachable_ warning. This is an example of WAN connectivity monitoring feature of DMT SYSTEM. 

For more features, especially when going multi-device please read the [documentation](./DOCS.md) or visit one of our [meetups](https://dmt-system.com/). A lot of functionality is not documented until we test and consolidate it properly as a community and this is the main reason for our regular bi-yearly meetups.

## Keep up to date

```
dmt next
```

You update DMT ENGINE through this command on your main device.

## Install or update DMT on your other devices

```
dmt update user@ip
```

With this DMT SYSTEM core idea you replicate the global DMT ENGINE that you got from source through install to one or more devices that you own or manage.  Along with core DMT ENGINE you also pass the replica of your private user directory (`~/.dmt/user`) so that your devices can execute your own customized version of the engine reliably and independently.

Read the documentation for more info on this very powerful aspect.

You can also update all nearby devices with:

```
dmt nearby update
```

Or just use

```
dmt nearby
```

to see what other devices on your local area network are powered by DMT ENGINE.
